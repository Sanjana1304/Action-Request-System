# Action-Request-System

## Client Description: 
The client a product is being developed for is Techsolium Inc. After meeting with the client, the problem they face was identified as not having a system through which customers can input their service requests. The product that will be developed to solve this problem is an action request system, which would receive customer requests that will be sent to the appropriate faculty. The faculty/staff can then develop software for their clients without extensive consultation with the customers. 


## Proposed Solution: 
	
After meeting with the client it was decided that an action request system would be created for the client Techsolium Inc.  It was made clear that an action request system was lacking from the company and that it was required to become more efficient. An action request system would allow for the company to receive requests from customers without excessive interaction and time. It would also act as an account for what the customer has requested and would minimize the extra steps currently being taken when receiving a customer request. 
  
  
## Software Justification: 
-	This action-request system will be created using Java as the main programming language as Java is necessary for building the basis of the system. 
-	Java Swing for the Graphical User Interface(front- end)
-	MySQL will be used as a third party database to store data obtained by the action request system. 


## Features: 
- The action request system has easy customer usability and is customer-friendly. 
- The requests received is visible to all faculty/staff(Admins) in charge of processing the customer requests. 
- The system is updated to show that as each request is approved or reviewed by a faculty/staff member.
